          <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
          <p>I started learning programming languages when I first started college but I'm an ambitious learner and I have interest for programming.
          I know object oriented programming and data structures in Java. I did many projects using Python in my project class. Also, I know C and SQL.</p>

          <h3>Tools & Technologies</h3>
          <p>I know how to use MS Office applications. I used them many times in college and high school. I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and Bootstrap by myself because
            I'm interested in web development. I like creating new websites using my knowledge and creativity. Also, I developed a game using Unity as a class project.</p>

          <h3>Languages</h3>
          <p> Turkish is my native language so I can speak very well. I was always interested in learning new languages and I've always wanted to
          speak in a foreign language as if it's my native language. Thus, I studied hard and I can talk English in the advanced level.
        I started to learn Spanish in high school and I have certificate of A2 level.</p>
